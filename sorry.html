        <h2>My Dearest ❤️</h2>
        <p>I'm sorry. I know words can't erase what happened, but please let my heart explain:</p>

        <blockquote>
          I saw the mistake, I feel the hurt I caused, and I wish I could take it back. You mean the world to me — your smile, your voice, your little quirks. Losing your trust scares me more than anything.
        </blockquote>

        <p>I promise to listen more, to be kinder, and to show you how much you matter every day.</p>
